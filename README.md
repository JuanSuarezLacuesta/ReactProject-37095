React Project - 37095 - Juan Suarez Lacuesta

# movieGate
## _If you watch a movie theres a 99% chance that you are eating or drinking something!_

The whole idea of "movieGate" is to sell snacks for the movies that you are going to watch, maybe in you house or maybe in the theatre

- Buying is as easy as selecting what you want and adding to your cart
- You have many items to choose from

## Dependencies

- _VITE_ was used in this project: this can be started by using "npm run dev"
- Boostrap: Helps a lot in the fast making of NavBar and icons, organization of the App is key!
- FireBase: All the data is pulled from this platform
- React Dom and Router in order to easily explore the app
